## The Problem
Any musician who has had to travel to perform has either had their precious instrument broken, or heard horror stories from their friends about that time their instrument was thrown out of a truck and damaged, and they had to scramble to find a suitable instrument to perform on short notice. Usually this happens on national and international flights when performers are forced to check their baggage or pay for an extra seat on the flight because the instrument is bulky. It can also happen while driving long distances to perform, especially when loading and unloading their instruments.

On top of the potential damage to an irreplaceable instrument, the cost of repairing any damage can be very expensive, if not impossible. For some instruments this is on the order of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. In some cases, instruments that are damaged can never achieve the same tone and quality again. Musicianâ€™s do not have many other options but to take their instruments with them and risk damage in transportation.

## Sketches
Below are sketches I put together as a potential for the final design.
